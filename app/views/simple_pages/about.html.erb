<h1>About Frankie's Frukt</h1>
<p>Frankie has a passion.  A passionfruit.  Here at Frankie’s, we go to grape lengths to ensure we only send you the most appeeling and zest fruit we can rind.<br><br>Dissatisfied with the quality of fruit available in the grocery stores in Stockholm, Frankie began to seek out alternative suppliers for her daily vitamin C punch.  To her delight, suppliers were plentiful; taste was delectable; and cost was not prohibitive.  After her colleagues were left speachless by the reddest of berries and juiciest of nectarines, Frankie saw the pearfect opportunity to share the zest she had found and seeded Frankie’s Frukt.<br><br>With Frankie, you have the ability to pearchase your favourite apples and oranges when you need them or give us your weekly budget and be surprised with the delicious flavours we put together in one of our fruit salads.  We source seasonally from both local suppliers and the best of what the world can offer.  Note that we are conscious of fruit miles, work with collectives to reduce our carbon fruitprint. <br><br>This is an ever-growing journey and we wanted to take this opportunity to thank you, our customers, for walking it with us.  Thanks a bunch!</p>
